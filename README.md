[Cupcake Lane Jupyter Notebook](scripts/Cupcake_Lane.ipynb)- This is a minimal script to simulate a production line for a cupcake factory. It serves as a starting point for this repository and will be one of many examples.   

Flowveyor is a visualization tool for tracking the flow of production and consumption across the supply chain timeline, focusing on abstract flow movements along a conveyor belt.  

Check back later for updates to this project as it is in its nascent stages.
